Continuation of the AntBot development

This is a version 2.0 - "The Stupid Robot". The idea behind creating this amateur walking pattern was to make the robot move as SOON as possible, regardless of the methodology


Patch Notes:

+ Replaced servo brackets (Aluminium > Steel)
+ Added *stupid* straight-walking function
